## Description

For this project, a marketing agency has "hired" me to refactor an existing site with the goal of making it more accessible. Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. Also, accessible sites are optimized for search engines meaning they will rank higher. I have learned that being as specific as possible with the semantic HTML elements, instead of using < div > for everything, as well as with the site title and the image alt attributes can help solve the accessibility issue. So can structuring both the HTML and CSS pages in a logical order making it easier to read.
